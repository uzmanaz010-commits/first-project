        <h1>history of Pakistan</h1>
        <p>Pakistan's history spans thousands of years, from ancient civilizations in the Indus Valley to its emergence
            as an independent nation in 1947. The country's modern history is defined by its struggle for a separate
            Muslim homeland, regional conflicts, and periods of both democratic and military rule.
        </p>
        <h3>Ancient and pre-Islamic history</h3>
        <h4>Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3300–1700 BCE):</h4> The region of modern-day Pakistan was home to one of the
        world's earliest urban civilizations, centered around the cities of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.
        <h4>Achaemenid Empire (c. 518 BCE): </h4>The area became the easternmost satrapy of the Persian Achaemenid
        Empire under Darius I.
        <h4>Alexander the Great (326 BCE): </h4>Alexander invaded the region, defeating local rulers like King Porus
        before his troops refused to advance further into the Indian subcontinent.
        <h4>Maurya Empire (c. 321–185 BCE):</h4> Following Alexander's withdrawal, Chandragupta Maurya and his grandson
        Ashoka extended the Mauryan Empire to incorporate parts of modern-day Pakistan.
        <h4>Greco-Buddhist cultures:</h4> In the following centuries, the region saw the rise of the Indo-Greek and
        Kushan
        kingdoms, which fostered a unique blend of Hellenistic and Buddhist art and culture, particularly in the
        Gandhara region.
